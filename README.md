# Caradoc - a PDF parser and validator

Caradoc is a parser and validator of PDF files written in OCaml. This is version 0.3 (beta).

Caradoc provides many commands to analyze PDFs, as well as an interactive user interface in console.

Caradoc was presented at the the third Workshop on Language-Theoretic Security (LangSec) in May 2016.
More information is available on the [website of the conference](http://spw16.langsec.org/papers.html#caradoc).


# Ongoing support

Caradoc has been originally developed at ANSSI, but new releases are
not provided by the agency anymore.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to get upstream versions of the project
must visit https://github.com/caradoc-org/caradoc as this page now
**only serves archive purposes**.
